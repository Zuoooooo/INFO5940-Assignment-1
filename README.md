### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure OpenAI API Key  

Since `docker-compose.yml` expects environment variables, follow these steps:  

#### ‚û§ Option 1: Set the API Key in `.env` (Recommended)  

1. Inside the project folder, create a `.env` file:  

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add the class API key and base URL:  

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.ai.it.cornell.edu/
   TZ=America/New_York
   ```

3. Modify `docker-compose.yml` to include this `.env` file:  

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     devcontainer:
       container_name: info-5940-devcontainer
       build:
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
         target: devcontainer
       environment:
         - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
         - OPENAI_BASE_URL=${OPENAI_BASE_URL}
         - TZ=${TZ}
       volumes:
         - '$HOME/.aws:/root/.aws'
         - '.:/workspace'
       env_file:
         - .env
   ```

4. Restart the container:  

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Now, API key will be automatically loaded inside the container.

# Step 2: 

After that, open docker and select "images" run "file name" -- info5940-assignment-1

# Step 3: 

Return to VScode, press shift+command+p, select: Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container

Select From 'docker-compose.yml' and then directly click 'OK'

# Step 4: Install the reuired Library

1. pip install pdfminer.six

Now you can see there is no underline on the top library list and make sure the library is a new version.

# Step 5 Run the application

In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing chatbot.py, then run:

- streamlit run assignmentchatbot.py

Open any link you want, and right now you can test

# Feature
When you haven't uploaded any files to the chatbot, if you ask questions like "What is my name?" or "Who is Ayham Boucher?", the chatbot will respond with "I don't know..." and indicate "Unknown source" in the answer.

For more general questions like "What is LLM?", the chatbot will provide its own answer but still display "Unknown source" as there are no uploaded documents to reference.

However, after uploading some files (for example, the Knowledge Base files from class, such as Cornell.txt and Duke.txt), if you ask "Who is Ayham Boucher?" again, the chatbot will provide a more specific response, such as "He teaches INFO-5940 at Cornell and INFO-6000 at Duke." The source will now be attributed to the uploaded files instead of "Unknown source."
